**We want you to implement a small project. This task should take approx. two hours: Create a web application, which informs about past SpaceX launches.**

> This project will use the open [SpaceX-API v4](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/README.md). All used endpoints are `GET` requests without authentication.

- The desktop layout of the application is based on the wireframes in the `/wireframes` folder. (Hint: The whole application is centered on the screen.)
  - _Implement your own design based on the layout defined in the wireframes._
  - _Find also a proper responsive behaviour for the mobile layout by yourself._
- On the initial start of the application the latest three SpaceX launches are shown in a sorted order.
  - _[See endpoint documentation](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/launches/v4/past.md) (For the record: In our case, it's sufficient to use this endpoint here instead of creating a limiting query, even if this means you retrieve much more data than you need.)_
  - ![Wireframe for initial started application](./wireframes/wireframe-initial.png 'Wireframe for initial started application')
- There is a search form (consists of text input and submit button) for requesting a launch by its ID.
  - _[See endpoint documentation](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/blob/master/docs/launches/v4/one.md)_
  - _The page doesn't reload when submitting the form._ // useState
- A valid request for a launch ID results in a detailed view of this launch.
  - The elapsed time since the launch is a live counter in the format hh:mm:ss. // new Date()
  - ![Wireframe for valid requested launch ID](./wireframes/wireframe-detail-success.png 'Wireframe for valid requested launch ID')
- An invalid request for a launch ID results in a simple error message on the screen.
  - ![Wireframe for invalid requested launch ID](./wireframes/wireframe-detail-error.png 'Wireframe for invalid requested launch ID')

### Getting started 🚀

This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/), so you have a ready-for-coding boilerplate.

Make sure to install the project dependencies with `npm install`.

Start the project application with `npm start` and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Developing 💻

This boilerplate gives you access to CSS, CSS modules, JavaScript (ES6+) and React out of the box.
You can add any additional dependency.

Please put all your code inside the `/src` folder, to make the review easier for us.

Please don't touch any files in the root folder nor the `/public` folder.

### Finishing 🏁

You don't need to host this project anywhere, we keep it simple:

1. Remove the `/node_modules` folder and the `/package-lock.json` file.
2. Compress the project directory into a `.zip` file.
3. Send the compressed project directory back to us.
